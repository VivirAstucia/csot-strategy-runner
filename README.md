# CSOT - Low Latency - Week 1 - Replay Engine

> Mission: Build a minimal C++ trading-platform runner that executes a judge-defined strategy spec, replays historical market ticks against it, verifies correctness, measures end-to-end latency per decision, and prints a summary.
  
## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build -j
```

## RUN INSTRUCIONS
- RUN Replay Engine with provided hist and bench
```bash
./build/quant_runner ./build/spec_strategy.so data/synthetic_large1.csv 
```
- Rum Replay Engine with google benchmark
```bash
./build/spec_strategy.so ./data/synthetic_large1.csv
```

## HARDWARE
- CPU: Intel Ultra 5 225H
- RAM: 32 GB
- OS: Fedora Linux 44 (Workstation Edition)
- Kernel: Linux 7.0.10-201.fc44.x86_64
  
## Latency Results
| Metric        |      Value |
| ------------- | ---------: |
| CPU Frequency |   1700 MHz |
| Count         | 10,000,000 |
| p50           |    ≤ 16 ns |
| p90           |    ≤ 16 ns |
| p99           |    ≤ 32 ns |
| p999          |   ≤ 128 ns |

## Performance Profiling 
```bash
perf stat -ddd ./build/quant_bench ./build/spec_strategy.so ./data/synthetic_large1.csv
```
Note : Use `taskset -c` to avoid core migration and more consistent results.

## One thing that surprised me
- How small algebraic transformations can have a significant impact on latency.
- Interning symbols into a shared lookup table singinifiantly reduced latency by avoiding string comparisons.
- Reducing branch unpredictability improved p90 and p99 latency.
